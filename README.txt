Synopsis :

This is my first "real" game made with unity. I never thought to publish my game before but when i saw my game became bigger and bigger i thought it can be a good idea.
As i assumed my game will be never published, the code and the game is wrote in french. But i'm going to translate them as soon as possible.

This game is a simple endless space shooter with bosses : the longer you survive the harder ennemies are.
There are a highscore board, but it's not currently working because i have nowhere to host my database


Motivation : 

I made this game to learn how to use unity but also for show my personnal projects and for fun ! 


Tests : 

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.


Contributors :

I'm currently alone.
